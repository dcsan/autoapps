**Check out the [releases page] for the latest build, updated daily.**

Download the _complete collection_ of [+200](essays.csv) essays from [Paul Graham] website and export them in [EPUB], [MOBI] and Markdown for easy [AFK] reading. It turned out to be a whooping +500k words. I used the RSS originally made by [Aaron Swartz] [shared] by PG himself, `feedparser`, `html2text`, `htmldate` and `Unidecode` libraries for data cleaning and acquisition. 

## Dependencies for MacOS

To create the EPUB/MOBI files you should have installed [python3], [pandoc] and [calibre] for Kindle readers.

```bash
brew install python@3
brew install --build-from-source pandoc
brew install --cask calibre
```

## Usage

Run the [Makefile](./Makefile) in the root directory using `make all`.
